This directory contains the LaTex files, etc, needed to create the
Miriad Users Manual. In particular
	userguide.tex	The LaTex source for the user guide
	userhtml.tex	The LaTex source, which, when converted to
			html, produces a reasonable document

	Buildguide	A shell script used to generate the users guide
	Buildhtml	A shell script used to generate the html
			document.

Most of the remaining files are either some form of include file,
or are generated by the "Build" scripts.

Note that these scripts require a number of system utilities. These
include latex, dvips, latex2html, fig2dev, makeindex, gnuplot ...

			 and their keywords.
