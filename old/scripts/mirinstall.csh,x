#* mirinstall - Put Miriad source files in the right directories
#& rjs
#: user utility
#+
#  Usage: mirinstall [-l] dir files...
#
#  mirinstall is a utility to copy (source) files to the standard
#  Miriad directories. A backup of any old version (with a time-stamp
#  extension) is created in $MIR/old, and the file is also optionally
#  copied to the $MIR/diffs/changes directory. File protection and
#  update stamps are taklen care of.
#
#  Arguments:
#    dir	This gives the Miriad directory to copy the files to
#		For example: prog
#    files...	This gives the list of files to process.
#    -l		The local-only flag. Normally a copy of the file is also
#		made if $MIR/diffs/changes. This prevents such a copy
#		being made.
